# Write a method, filter_lengths(strings, length), that accepts an array of strings
# and a length as args. The method should return an array containing the strings
# that have at least the given length. The length argument should be optional; if no length
# is passed in, then 5 should be used as the length.

    # Start off with iterating through strings array
    # While in the iteration, check length of each ele
    # Select method to create a new array of words that are greater than or
    # equal to length (make the select method the return)
    return strings.select { |word| word.length >= length }
